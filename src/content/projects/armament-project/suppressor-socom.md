# Known Issues

  - The actual SOCOM silencer is much less accurate in its construction, being welded in a few places. These inaccuracies are usually only to the degree of a couple of millimeters, and as such have not been reflected.
  - The silencer does not contain any internal silencing elements, and has “foam inserts” instead of acoustic baffles.
