The thirty round magazine of the M4A1 includes two helper objects. Two look-at targets and two paths, which each round in the double-stack magazine conforms to.

# Known Issues

 - The bolt barrier and bolt are not accurately modelled.
 - The magazine well, magazine stop plate, and magazine entrance (top of the magazine) is not accurately modelled.
 - The 5.56x45mm cartridge and bullet are not accurately modelled.
 - The grip for a Tokyo Mauri M4 fits a motor, which makes it much wider than on the real-steel item.
