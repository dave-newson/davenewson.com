This “red dot” is projected from the 1mm nub on the back of the inner most cylinder.

A battery has been included inside the model.

# Item Specifications

Designed in conjunction with Walther, the Tasco range of red-dot reflex scopes are of both a high quality and fairly inexpensive.

The Tasco scope uses an adjustable illuminated red-dot reflected off of two inner panes of glass. This creates the illusion of a projected red-dot on its target. This scope offers no level of zoom.
