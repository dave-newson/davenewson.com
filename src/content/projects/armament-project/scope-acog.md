This model was created in 3D Studio Max R7 over a period of approximately 5 days.

This scope is modelled more closely to the Guarder 1×30 ACOG scope on which it is based, than a real Trijicon 4×30 ACOG scope..

Two batteries has been included inside the model, although a real ACOG scope requires no batteries.
