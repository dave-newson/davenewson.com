This model was created in 3D Studio Max R7 over a period of approximately 1 week.

To remove the pin from this grenade the hoop must be twisted violently up or down to release it from the catch on the opposite side.

The “hammer” under the spoon is at an angle of 45 degrees.

The third image in the thumbnails above is a map of markings for the grenade, which can be applied as a texture to the main cylinder. There should also be a six digit serial number on the base of the grenade.
