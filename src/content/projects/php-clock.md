A simple PHP-based ASCII-Art Analog clock.

<div class="text-center">
    <a href="/php-clock/" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank">View Clock</a>
</div>

Built in a few hours for a coding exercise, this PHP script uses a few simple classes to generate an ASCII-Art analog clock.

The renderer code layout was inspired by a recent foray into JavaScript HTML5 Canvas game-engine renderers.
