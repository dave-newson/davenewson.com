Had another crack at matchmove and some more advanced after effects tricks.

Lessons learnt:
  - Keying out the sky won't help with the buildings in the background, so you'll end up masking out everything else frame by frame. Avoid at all costs.
  - Remember to grab an HDR on the day so you don't have to match the lighting by hand.

Exported the individual passes (light, occlusion, diffuse) through vray EXRs, then added them together in after effects and tweaked the exposure/levels to match the scene. Missile done with a simple particle effect. Tracers created in 3d studio and then added multiple glow effects to achieve the same look as in half-life 2. Bullet impacts and the explosion taken from stock videos.
