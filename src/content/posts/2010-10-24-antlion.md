Despite doing a lot of reading on the process of match move/motion tracking and compositing, I hadn't actually planned to do anything with this knowledge. One day however, while waiting with at Epping Station in Sydney I had the sudden urge to film a quick 10 second moving segment for later use in a test of all this knowledge.

Despite the low-light noise recorded by the Canon EOS 60D, the scene tracked remarkably well in Syntheyes with almost no correction required. It didn't take much to kick this over to 3D Studio Max, extract the animation and model from Half-Life 2 and cook up a batch of OpenEXR images for import into After Effects. The whole process went remarkably smoothly, which was a compelte suprise to me.

That said, you can still see some issues with this initial test of my worklow;

  - The first frame of the video isn't correctly matched to the footage - this is an issue with VirtualDub which I used to rencode the video before uploading to YouTube.

  - The compositing of the Antlion lacks shadows (besides Ambion Occlusion), and he isn't blurred as he goes further out of focus.
