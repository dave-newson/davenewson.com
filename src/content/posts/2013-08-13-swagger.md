# [REST API Documentation in Zend Framework 2 with Swagger](/tutorials/php/rest-api-documentation-in-zend-framework-2-with-swagger)

People talk about the self-documenting ideal of REST APIs, citing [the Richardson Maturity Model](http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html "http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html"), and occasionally this is interpreted as “a good REST <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> should be _it's own_ documentation”. I personally think a REST <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> should be documented out the wazoo, especially if your work is spread across multiple developers, so any utility that can help with making documentation simple to write and easy to maintain is a winner, in my book.

A recent project called implementing a REST <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>; with multiple developers involved, I needed a way to keep the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> documented, but I didn't much fancy forcing my developers to both comment the functions and maintain a separate <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> document, as when push-comes-to-shove on a deadline, that's the last thing anyone will be keeping up to date.

Step to the plate [Swagger](https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/ "https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/"), an open-source “standard” for REST <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> documentation, using JSON.

[Swagger-UI](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui "https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui") aims to give you a standalone interface for your <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> which interperets the documentation into something readable, while also giving you “Try me!” tools, allowing you to execute the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> calls directly from the documentation.

[Swagger-PHP](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php "https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php") can also be used in PHP 5.3+ projects to auto-generate the JSON documentation based on structured comments (annotations) in your code. Modules such as [SwaggerModule](https://github.com/outeredge/SwaggerModule "https://github.com/outeredge/SwaggerModule") can also help to integrate Swagger-PHP directly into a Zend FW2 project.

This guide aims to give you an understanding of Swagger, how to leverage the comment system of Swagger-PHP, and show you how to integrate Swagger with a Zend Framework 2 or CakePHP 2 project.

## What's so good about Swagger?

The [Swagger-UI Petstore Demo](http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/ "http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/") shows a little bit of what you can achieve with Swagger; the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> at the top of the page is the location of the [demo Swagger JSON document](http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/api/api-docs "http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/api/api-docs") to be loaded, which is processed by Swagger-UI and turned into the in-page documentation. As the document is JSON, it can technicall be read by anything - it doesn't _have_ to be Swagger-UI.

Swagger-UI also provides “Try it out” buttons for each request type (except delete operations), so if you use Swagger from the start, you can use it for testing your <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> too!

## Swagger Documents

Swagger-UI actually accepts two types of JSON Swagger documents:

  - **Resource Listing** documents, which direct Swagger-UI to further documentation files.
  - **<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Declaration** documents, which detail the actual resources (<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> calls).

In the [Swagger-UI Petstore Demo](http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/ "http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/") the initial document file is a Resource Listing, which supplies a series of <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Declaration documents to be loaded.

Here's a snippet of the Resource Listing document ([http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/api/api-docs](http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/api/api-docs "http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/api/api-docs")):

<pre class="code">
{
    "apiVersion":"1.0.0", "swaggerVersion":"1.2",
    "apis":[
        {"path":"/user", "description":"Operations about user"},
        {"path":"/pet","description":"Operations about pets"}
    ]
}
</pre>

Further documentation for the Resource Listing format can be found on the [Swagger Core Wiki - Resource Listing](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki/Resource-Listing "https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki/Resource-Listing") page.

The listed APIs are _relative_ links from the initial document (/api/api-docs) to further JSON documents, despite the preceding slash which normally indicates an absolute path from the domain root. For instance, the ”/pet” document referenced above is located at ”/api/api-docs/pet”. Swagger-UI will see each listed <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>, and load the document files for each.

Here's an example snippet from the Pet document which is subsequently loaded ([http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/api/api-docs/pet](http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/api/api-docs/pet "http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/api/api-docs/pet")):

<pre class="code">
{
    "apiVersion":"1.0.0","swaggerVersion":"1.2","
    basePath":"http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/api",
    "resourcePath":"/pet",
    "produces":["application/json","application/xml","text/plain","text/html"],
    "apis":[
        {
            "path":"/pet/{petId}",
            "operations":[
            {
                "method":"GET",
                "summary":"Find pet by ID",
                "notes":"Returns a pet based on ID",
                "type":"Pet",
                "nickname":"getPetById",
                "produces":["application/json","application/xml"]
            }
        }
    ]
}
</pre>

Further documentation on the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Declaration format can be found on the [Swagger Core Wiki - API Declaration](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki/API-Declaration "https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki/API-Declaration") page.

Without going into too much depth, the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> array lists a series of paths, which each can have a series of operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete, etc). These operations have a description, return type, etc, etc..

## I don't want to write lots of JSON!

That's good, because instead you can use a Swagger documentation generator to parse code annotations (structured comments) and generate the documents on-the-fly!

Under PHP there's [Zircote's own Swagger-PHP](http://zircote.com/swagger-php/ "http://zircote.com/swagger-php/") (also on [github](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php "https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php")). Swagger-PHP uses a hierarchy of classes placed within the comments of your application, called _annotations_. These annotations are parsed by Swagger-PHP into the JSON document format.

An example of a function using the annotation format:

<pre class="code">
    use Swagger\Annotations as SWG;

    /**
     * @SWG\Operation(
     *      partial="admin.clients.specific.update",
     *      summary="Update a specific client",
     *      notes="User must be an Administrator",
     *      @SWG\Parameters(
     *          @SWG\Parameter(
     *              name="client_id",
     *              paramType="path",
     *              dataType="int",
     *              required="true",
     *              description="Client ID"
     *          )
     *      )
     * )
     */
    public function adminUpdate( $clientId )
    {
        ... code ...
    }
</pre>

This annotation formatting appears a little unusual, however the structure is easy to follow and simple to use.

More information on the format and use of Swagger-PHP can be found on the [Swagger-PHP documentation pages](http://zircote.com/swagger-php/index.html "http://zircote.com/swagger-php/index.html").

## Integrating Swagger with Zend Framework 2

Let's look into integrating this magic directly into a Zend Framework 2 application. I'm assuming you're using [the Zend Framework Skeleton Application](http://framework.zend.com/downloads/skeleton-app "http://framework.zend.com/downloads/skeleton-app") for this exercise, using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/ "http://getcomposer.org/").

### Composer.json

<pre class="code">
{
    "require": {
        "php": ">=5.3.3",
        "zendframework/zendframework": "2.2.*",
        "outeredge/swagger-module": "dev-master"
    }
}
</pre>

Execute `php composer.phar install` to get things underway. Fetching Swagger Module will also install an appropriate version of Swagger-PHP.

### Zend Application Config

**config/application.config.php**

<pre class="code">
<?php
return array(
    // This should be an array of module namespaces used in the application.
    'modules' => array(
        'Application',
        'SwaggerModule',
    ),
</pre>

This will enable Swagger Module in your application.

### Swagger Module Configuration

Copy `/vendor/outeredge/swagger-module/config/swagger.global.php.dist` to `/config/autoload/swagger.global.php`

**swagger.global.php**

<pre class="code">
return array(
    'swagger' => array(
        'paths' => array(
            __DIR__ . '/../../module/User/config',
            __DIR__ . '/../../module/User/src/User/Controller',
        ),
    )
);
</pre>

The swagger config should contain paths to directories you want Swagger-PHP to process for annotations. In the case above, Swagger Module is being instructed to look at both the User module's controllers _and_ the user module config files. More on this later.

**As of 2014-01-16 you will need to add the following additional lines to `/vendor/outeredge/swagger-module/config/module.config.php` to enable the ViewJsonStrategy and fix errors that may appear on the default document generation route.**

<pre class="code">
    'view_manager' => array(
        'strategies' => array(
            'ViewJsonStrategy'
        ),
    ),
</pre>

### Routes and Controllers

Swagger Module comes with default routes for generating the json Swagger documents (defined in `/vendor/outeredge/swagger-module/config/module.config.php`).

You can generate the (empty) Swagger document by browsing to `/api/docs`

## Integrating CakePHP 2

### Composer.json

Setting up CakePHP using Composer is [an entire article in itself](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/installation/advanced-installation.html "http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/installation/advanced-installation.html"), however installing Swagger-PHP on CakePHP only requires the one extra entry to your composer.json file:

<pre class="code">
{
    "require": {
        "zircote/swagger-php": "dev-master"
    },
}
</pre>

### CakePHP Plugin

I've put together a quick CakePHP 2 plugin for Swagger-PHP which should act similarly to Swagger Module as per the above. [Get CakePHP-Swagger on GitHub](https://github.com/dave-newson/cakephp-swagger "https://github.com/dave-newson/cakephp-swagger")

Simply clone this repo into your CakePHP 2 `app/Plugin` directory, then add the following like to your `Config/bootstrap.php`: `CakePlugin::load( array( 'Swagger' ⇒ array( 'routes' ⇒ true, 'bootstrap'⇒true ) ) );`

Browse to `/api/docs` to see the documentation.

## Adding Swagger Annotations

Regardless of the framework you're using, now we have those (empty) documents we need to add some Swagger Annotations to our code comments.

Annotations don't _need_ to be lined up exactly with a function, so _for testing purposes_, just throw this code into the ApiController class.

<pre class="code">
/**
 * @SWG\Resource(
 *      resourcePath="/test",
 *      @SWG\Api(
 *          path="/test-path",
 *          @SWG\Operation(
 *              nickname="test",
 *              method="GET",
 *              summary="This is a test"
 *          )
 *      )
 * )
 */
</pre>

If you were to now call `/api/docs/test` you should see the JSON representation of the above, with “This is a test” lurking somewhere in the code.

Visiting `/api/docs` should also produce a Resource Listing document with a reference to /test.

## Setting up Swagger UI

[Swagger UI](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui "https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui") is a stand-alone <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>/JavaScript application for viewing Swagger documents - you can drop the Swagger-UI collection of files anywhere and get started reading Swagger documents, it's really as simple as that.

For myself, I placed an instance of Swagger-UI as the homepage of my <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> (`/api`), using standard routing in the framework of your choice.

## Swagger UI Quirks

  - Swagger-PHP annotations will _not_ be loaded from files without `use Swagger\Annotations as SWG;` in the header. This is intentional, and can actually he helpful for debugging.
  - Swagger-PHP is sensitive to trailing commas, unlike PHP. You'll get an error if you have a trailing comma in your swagger annotation.
  - If there is an error in your annotation formatting, Swagger-PHP will produce a PHP error. This will stop Swagger-UI from loading the URLs, and may get stuck on an “200: some-unhelpful-url” notice. Simply load the `/api/docs` file and check for errors if this starts happening.

## Separating Route Annotations From Controller Annotations

Under our framework of choice we may find our routes are defined in a separate file to our controller code. We have to specify the paths and methods (GET, POST, etc) for each of our Swagger annotations, but we don't want to be putting path information in our Controller files. Similarly, we don't want to put descriptions and params in our routes files. How do we separate the two definitions but keep everything working?

Simply, we use the new `@SWG\Partial()` element. This allows for multiple detached elements to link back to the one _Partial_ parent. You'll then and up with one item that has all of the attributes.

That's not a very good explanation, so let's see it in practice.

<pre class="code">
// routing.php
// This file would contain our routes.

use Swagger\Annotations as SWG;

/**
 * @SWG\Resource(
 *      resourcePath="/pets",
 *      @SWG\Api(
 *          path="/pets/getPet",
 *          @SWG\Operation(
 *              httpMethod="GET",
 *              nickname="getPet",
 *              @SWG\Partial("pets.getPet")
 *          )
 *      )
 * )
 */

// .. code ..
</pre>

<pre class="code">
// controller.php
// this file contains our controller methods
 
/**
 *  @SWG\Operation(
 *      partial="pets.getPet",
 *      summary="Fetches a list of all the pets"
 *  )
 */
 
// .. code ..
</pre>

When Swagger-PHP parses these two separate documents, it'll see the `partial=“pets.getPet”` reference and look for an `@SWG\Partial` element with a matching name. It'll then condense the two together, forming the one @Operation for our routes.php `/pets/getPet` with the summary from the controller.php.

This allows us to separate our route definitions from our method definitions.

If you forget to define an `@Partial` or `partial=””` in either direction and end up with an orphan, an error will be raised.
