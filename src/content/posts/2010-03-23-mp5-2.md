There were two points I disliked with the original MP5 Wiimote mod – the suppressor and the foregrip.

The suppressor housing was big, cumbersome, heavy and felt like overkill as it just housed the WiiMote camera. I also thought the wiring and the hackjob I'd done to mount it inside the suppressor was pretty poor, and there _must_ be a way to house the camera inside the MP5 itself - ideally inside the original MP5 muzzle.

The foregrip shortcomings were more cosmetically obvious – the cutout for the joystick wasn’t perfect, the method i used to mount the nunchuck PCD led to nylon threads protruding through the surface of the forgrip, and the buttons were held onto the surface by lots of unsightly nuts.

There had to be a solution, right?

## Fixing the Camera


I discovered the Wiimote camera was actually a 9mm square camera inside a 14mm “cup” housing; it was placed inside the cup to help with surface mounting on the Wiimote PCB.

I de-soldered the legs of the cup and easily popped the camera from its housing. The Wiimote IR camera actually has eight 0.5mm tracks on the back, to which I then resoldered the wires.

During this arduous task I accidentally soldered two of the tracks together. Due to the force and heat involved in removing this join, I accidentally tore one of the tiny tracks off the camera – leaving 7 perfectly soldered tracks, and one huge problem. Luckily the track connects to the internals via a tiny 0.25mm indentation - I very caefully soldered the wire to this point and then glued the ever-loving-hell out of it to secure it in place permenantly.

The MP5's original muzzle is only 9mm in diameter, however the camera is 9mm square. Trying to jam the square peg in the round hole basically meant an 11mm diameter hole was needed. A good drill bit, patience and about half a day eventually led to the muzzle being wide enough to cram the camera and its cabled inside. I then capped off the end with some IR-plastic to hide and secure the camera, with it pressing up against the window.

## Fitting a new Foregrip

There was little I could do with the old foregrip once the holes had been cut, so I decided to pick up another ICS MP5 foregrip (~£15) and have another go.

The main difference I wanted to incorporate this time around was each button has a threaded neck, so instead of using their supplied nuts to hold them in position on the exterior of the foregrip, I would drill holes the right size for the threaded switch necks, tap them out to the appropriate thread sizes, and carefully screwed each switch into place. This was a fiddly as anything and I’m glad I have small fingers, but once complete it was a perfect fit.

For the nunchuck itself, I merely took the rods previously cut and instead of feeding them through the body of the foregrip I simply glue-gunned the rods to the inside of the foregrip. This worked really well as there’s now a tiny amount of give when putting pressure on the nunchuck joystick, which is actually a bonus.

The final touch was to buy a black Nunchuck body kit, which included a black version of the nunchuck joystick – completing the “gun” look once more.

## Additional features

Two minor additions I thought I would try, as the pieces were still laying around:

[![](/assets/media/posts/2010-03-23-mp5-2/004_rumble1_1_.jpg?w=300&tok=8ebc80)](/assets/media/posts/2010-03-23-mp5-2/004_rumble1_1_.jpg "projects:mp5-wiimote:004_rumble1_1_.jpg") I added the Wiimote rumble motor inside the MP5′s grip, which wold hopefully induce some minor vibration into the hardguard for games like Ghost Squad.

[![](/assets/media/posts/2010-03-23-mp5-2/005_speaker1_1_.jpg?w=300&tok=47aebf)](/assets/media/posts/2010-03-23-mp5-2/005_speaker1_1_.jpg "projects:mp5-wiimote:005_speaker1_1_.jpg") I also added the (damaged) Wiimote speaker into the rear of the gun. Oddly there was a perfect space for it right begind the gearbox in the upper receiver, and after some testing I discovered the speaker still worked, though quieter.

In summary, the gun was now smaller, lighter, prittier, and included a few features which were missing from the original build.
